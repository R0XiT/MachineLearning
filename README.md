# 📦 Invoice Analytics Portal

An end-to-end Machine Learning application for **Freight Cost Prediction** and **Invoice Risk Assessment**, built using **Python, Scikit-learn, SQLite, and Streamlit**.

🚀 **Live Demo:** "https://machinelearning-km2muy3d4kfxx3y6jyptdw.streamlit.app/"

---

## 📌 Overview

Invoice Analytics Portal helps finance teams automate invoice analysis by combining machine learning with business rules.

The application provides two intelligent modules:

- 🚚 **Freight Cost Prediction**
- 🚨 **Invoice Manual Approval Flagging**

Instead of manually reviewing thousands of invoices, the system predicts freight costs and automatically identifies invoices that may require manual approval due to abnormal patterns.

---

## ✨ Features

### 🚚 Freight Cost Prediction

Predicts the expected freight cost for an invoice using:

- Quantity
- Invoice Amount (Dollars)

This assists with:

- Budget planning
- Cost forecasting
- Vendor negotiations
- Freight estimation

---

### 🚨 Invoice Risk Assessment

Predicts whether an invoice should be sent for **manual approval**.

The classifier analyzes features such as:

- Invoice Quantity
- Invoice Dollars
- Freight Cost
- Total Item Quantity
- Total Item Dollars

Invoices identified as risky are flagged for manual review.

## 🤖 Machine Learning Pipeline

### Freight Cost Prediction

**Task:** Regression

**Input Features**

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| Quantity | Number of units in the invoice |
| Invoice Dollars | Total invoice amount in USD |

**Models Evaluated & Results**

| Model | MAE | RMSE | R² Score |
|---|---|---|---|
| ✅ **Linear Regression** *(selected)* | **24.11** | **124.72** | **96.99%** |
| Decision Tree Regressor | 38.12 | 138.25 | 96.30% |
| Random Forest Regressor | 26.13 | 134.79 | 96.48% |

Linear Regression achieved the best MAE and R² score and is saved for inference.

---

### Invoice Manual Approval Flagging

**Task:** Binary Classification

**Target Variable**

Invoices are labeled using business rules based on:

- Difference between invoice amount and item total
- Average receiving delay

**Input Features**

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| Invoice Quantity | Number of units |
| Invoice Dollars | Total invoice amount |
| Freight | Freight cost |
| Total Item Quantity | Sum of all item quantities |
| Total Item Dollars | Sum of all item costs |

**Model**

- Random Forest Classifier

**Hyperparameter Tuning**

GridSearchCV was used to optimize:

- Number of estimators
- Maximum tree depth
- Split criterion
- Minimum samples per split
- Minimum samples per leaf

**Model Performance**

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Accuracy | 89% |
| Macro Avg Precision | 0.91 |
| Macro Avg Recall | 0.85 |
| Macro Avg F1 Score | 0.87 |

**Classification Report**

| Class | Precision | Recall | F1-Score | Support |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 (No Flag) | 0.87 | 0.98 | 0.92 | 725 |
| 1 (Flag) | 0.95 | 0.71 | 0.82 | 384 |
| **Weighted Avg** | **0.90** | **0.89** | **0.88** | **1109** |
